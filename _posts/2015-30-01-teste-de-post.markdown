[comment]: Expand selection to brackets (Ctrl + Shift + M)
[comment]: Expand selection to indentation (Ctrl + Shift + J)
[comment]: Expand selection to scope (Ctrl + Shift + Space)

[comment]: And much, much more...
[comment]: The Edit, Selection, Find and Goto menus are good places to look for handy editing tools. You [comment]: might end up using just a few of them, but the rest will still be there for when you need them.
